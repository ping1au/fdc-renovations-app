              Our experience with FDC was more then we could have hoped for.   They completed all work on time and as promised. 
  The workmanship was excellent, and the little things they did to fix issues that we had for years were more then we had expected. 
  The entire crew was friendly and easy to work with and they happily accommodated minor changes we asked for along the way. 
  The teamwork they demonstrated was truly impressive.  The time and attention they paid to the little details truly showed their 
  devotion to their crafts.  A couple of months after the work was completed, we got a call from Roger asking how things were 
  and if we had any issues.  The minor issues we did have (slight adjustments to closet doors..) were dealt with quickly as they 
  came by to make the required adjustments.  The renovations done were 30 years after our initial purchase of the home, 
  and it feels like we were given a brand-new home.
